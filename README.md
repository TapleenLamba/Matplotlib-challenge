# Matplotlib-challenge

Overview:

Welcome to the analysis of the recent animal study conducted by Pymaceuticals, Inc., specializing in anti-cancer medications. The study focused on potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a prevalent form of skin cancer. The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens.

Data:

The dataset comprises data from 249 mice with SCC tumors.
Various drug regimens were administered, and tumor development was observed over 45 days.
Tasks Accomplished:

1. Data Analysis:
Investigated the performance of Capomulin compared to other treatments.
2. Data Visualization:
Utilized Matplotlib to create informative visualizations for a comprehensive understanding of the study.

3. Key Tables and Figures:
Generated essential tables and figures to be included in the technical report.

Summary:

Capomulin showcased promising results in reducing tumor volume over the treatment period.
The drug exhibited a lower metastatic spread compared to other treatments.
Mice treated with Capomulin had a higher survival rate.
